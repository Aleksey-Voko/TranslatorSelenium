    <p>It has already been said that Python 3 breaks backwards compatibility with Python 2. Still, it is not a complete
        redesign. Also, it does not mean that every Python module written for a 2.x release will stop working under
        Python 3. It is possible to write completely cross-compatible code that will run on both major releases without
        additional tools or techniques, but usually it is possible only for simple applications.</p>
    <div class="section" title="Why should I care?">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">Why should I care?</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Despite my personal opinion on Python 2 compatibility, exposed earlier in this chapter, it is impossible to
            simply forget about it right at this time. There are still some useful packages (such as fabric, mentioned
            in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Deploying Code">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying the Code</em></span>)
            that are really worth using but are not likely to be ported in the very near future.</p>
        <p>Also, sometimes we may be constrained by the organization we work in. The existing legacy code may be so
            complex that porting it is not economically feasible. So, even if we decide to move on and live only in the
            Python 3 world from now on, it will be impossible to completely live without Python 2 for some time.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, it is very hard to name oneself a professional developer without giving something back to the
            community, so helping the open source developers in adding Python 3 compatibility to the existing packages
            is a good way to pay off the "moral debt" incurred by using them. This, of course, cannot be done without
            knowing the differences between Python 2 and Python 3. By the way, this is also a great exercise for those
            new in Python 3.</p></div>

        <p>The Python documentation is the best reference for differences between every release. Anyway, for readers'
            convenience, this section summarizes the most important ones. This does not change the fact that the
            documentation is mandatory reading for those not familiar with Python 3 yet (see <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html">https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html</a>).
        </p>
        <p>The breaking changes introduced by Python 3 can generally be divided into a few groups:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Syntax changes, wherein some syntax elements were
                    removed/changed and other elements were added
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Changes in the standard library</li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Changes in datatypes and collections</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section" title="Syntax changes">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h3 class="title">Syntax changes</h3></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Syntax changes that make it difficult for the existing code to run are the easiest to spot—they will
                cause the code to not run at all. The Python 3 code that features new syntax elements will fail to run
                on Python 2 and vice versa. The elements that are removed will make Python 2 code visibly incompatible
                with Python 3. The running code that has such issues will immediately cause the interpreter to fail
                raising a <code class="literal">SyntaxError</code> exception. Here is an example of the broken script
                that has exactly two statements, of which none will be executed due to the syntax error:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">print("hello world")
print "goodbye python2"</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Its actual result when run on Python 3 is as follows:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ python3 script.py</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  File "script.py", line 2</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    print "goodbye python2"</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>                         ^</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'</strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The list of such differences is a bit long and, from time to time, any new Python 3.x release may add new
                elements of syntax that will raise such errors on earlier releases of Python (even on the same 3.x
                branch). The most important of them are covered in <a class="link" href="ch02.html"
                                                                      title="Chapter 2. Syntax Best Practices – below the Class Level">Chapter

                    3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level</em></span>, so
                there is no need to list all of them here.</p>
            <p>The list of things dropped or changed from Python 2.7 is shorter, so here are the most important
                ones:</p>

                        statement but a function instead, so the parenthesis is now obligatory.

                    <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">from module import *</code>

                        floats too, so <code class="literal">5.0//2.0 == 2.0</code>.

        <div class="section" title="Changes in the standard library">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h3 class="title">Changes in the standard library</h3></div>

            </div>
            <p>Breaking changes in the standard library are the second easiest to catch after syntax changes. Each
                subsequent version of Python adds, deprecates, improves, or completely removes standard library modules.
                Such a process was regular also in the older versions of Python (1.x and 2.x), so it does not come as a
                shock in Python 3. In most cases, depending on the module that was removed or reorganized (like <code
                        class="literal">urlparse</code> being moved to <code class="literal">urllib.parse</code>), it
                will raise exceptions on the import time just after it was interpreted. This makes such issues so easy
                to catch. Anyway, in order to be sure that all such issues are covered, the full test code coverage is
                essential. In some cases (for example, when using lazily loaded modules), the issues that are usually
                noticed on import time will not appear before some modules are used in code as function calls. This is
                why, it is so important to make sure that every line of code is actually executed during tests suite.

                    <p><span class="strong"><strong>Lazily loaded modules</strong></span></p>
                    <p>A lazily loaded module is a module that is not loaded on import time. In Python, <code
                            class="literal">import</code> statements can be included inside of functions so import will
                        happen on a function call and not on import time. In some cases, such loading of modules may be
                        a reasonable choice but in most cases, it is a workaround for poorly designed module structures
                        (for example, to avoid circular imports) and should be generally avoided. For sure, there is no
                        justifiable reason to lazily load standard library modules.</p></div>

                    <div><h3 class="title">Changes in datatypes and collections</h3></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Changes in how Python represents datatypes and collections require the most effort when the developer
                tries to maintain compatibility or simply port existing code to Python 3. While incompatible syntax or
                standard library changes are easily noticeable and the most easy to fix, changes in collections and
                types are either nonobvious or require a lot of repetitive work. A list of such changes is long and,
                again, official documentation is the best reference.</p>
            <p>Still, this section must cover the change in how string literals are treated in Python 3 because it seems
                to be the most controversial and discussed change in Python 3, despite being a very good thing that now
                makes things more explicit.</p>
            <p>All string literals are now Unicode and <code class="literal">bytes</code> literals require a <code
                    class="literal">b</code> or <code class="literal">B</code> prefix. For Python 3.0 and 3.1 using
                <code class="literal">u</code> prefix (like <code class="literal">u"foo"</code>) was dropped and will
                raise a syntax error. Dropping that prefix was the main reason for all controversies. It made really
                hard to create code that was compatible in different branches of Python—version 2.x relied on this
                prefix in order to create Unicode literals. This prefix was brought back in Python 3.3 to ease the
                integration process, although without any syntactic meaning.</p></div>

    <div class="section" title="The popular tools and techniques used for maintaining cross-version compatibility">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">The popular tools and techniques used for maintaining cross-version
                    compatibility</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Maintaining compatibility between versions of Python is a challenge. It may add a lot of additional work
            depending on the size of the project but is definitely doable and worth doing. For packages that are meant
            to be reused in many environments, it is an absolute must have. Open source packages without well-defined
            and tested compatibility bounds are very unlikely to become popular, but also, closed third-party code that
            never leaves the company network can greatly benefit from being tested in different environments.</p>
        <p>It should be noted here that while this part focuses mainly on compatibility between various versions of
            Python, these approaches apply for maintaining compatibility with external dependencies like different
            package versions, binary libraries, systems, or external services.</p>
        <p>The whole process can be divided into three main areas, ordered by importance:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Defining and documenting target compatibility bounds
                    and how they will be managed
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Testing in every environment and with every
                    dependency version declared as compatible
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Implementing actual compatibility code</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Declaration of what is considered compatible is the most important part of the whole process because it gives
            the users of the code (developers) the ability to have expectations and make assumptions on how it works and
            how it can change in the future. Our code can be used as a dependency in different projects that may also
            strive to manage compatibility, so the ability to reason how it behaves is crucial.</p>
        <p>While this book tries to always give a few choices rather than to give an absolute recommendation on specific
            options, here is one of the few exceptions. The best way so far to define how compatibility may change in
            the future is by the proper approach to versioning numbers using <span class="emphasis"><em>Semantic Versioning</em></span>
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>), or shortly, semver. It describes a
            broadly accepted standard for marking the scope of change in code by the version specifier consisting only
            of three numbers. It also gives some advice on how to handle deprecation policies. Here is an excerpt from
            its summary:</p>
        <p>Given a version number <code class="literal">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, increment:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A <code class="literal">MAJOR</code> version when you
                    make incompatible API changes
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A <code class="literal">MINOR</code> version when you
                    add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A <code class="literal">PATCH</code> version when you
                    make backwards-compatible bug fixes
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the <code
                class="literal">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> format.</p>
        <p>When it comes to testing, the sad truth is that to be sure that code is compatible with every declared
            dependency version and in every environment (here, the Python version), it must be tested in every
            combination of these. This, of course, may not be possible when the project has a lot of dependencies
            because the number of combinations grows rapidly with every new dependency in a version. So, typically some
            trade off needs to be made so that running full compatibility tests does not take ages. A selection of tools
            that help testing in so-called matrixes is presented in <a class="link" href="ch10.html"
                                                                       title="Chapter 10. Test-Driven Development">Chapter
                10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Test-Driven Development</em></span>, that discusses testing in
            general.</p>
        <div class="note" style="" title="Note">
            <div class="inner"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                <p>The benefit of using projects that follow semver is that usually what needs to be tested are only
                    major releases because minor and patch releases are guaranteed not to include backwards incompatible
                    changes. This is only true if such projects can be trusted not to break such a contract.
                    Unfortunately, mistakes happen to everyone and backward incompatible changes happen in a lot of
                    projects, even on patch versions. Still, since semver declares strict compatibility on minor and
                    patch version changes, breaking it is considered a bug, so it may be fixed in patch release.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Implementation of the compatibility layer is last and also least important if bounds of that compatibility
            are well-defined and rigorously tested. Still there are some tools and techniques that every programmer
            interested in such a topic should know.</p>
        <p>The most basic is Python's <code class="literal">__future__</code> module. It ports back some features from
            newer Python releases back into the older ones and takes the form of import statement:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">from __future__ import &lt;feature&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Features provided by <code class="literal">future</code> statements are syntax-related elements that cannot
            be easily handled by different means. This statement affects only the module where it was used. Here is an
            example of Python 2.7 interactive session that brings Unicode literals from Python 3.0:</p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Python 2.7.10 (default, May 23 2015, 09:40:32) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; type("foo")  # old literals</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;type 'str'&gt;</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import unicode_literals</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; type("foo")  # now is unicode</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>&lt;type 'unicode'&gt;</strong></span>

        <p>Here is a list of all the available <code class="literal">__future__</code> statement options that developers
            concerned with 2/3 compatibility should know:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">division</code>: This adds a
                    Python 3 division operator (PEP 238)
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">absolute_import</code>: This
                    makes every form of <code class="literal">import</code> statement not starting with a dot character
                    interpreted as an absolute import (PEP 328)
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">print_function</code>: This
                    changes a <code class="literal">print</code> statement into a function call, so parentheses around
                    <code class="literal">print</code> becomes mandatory (PEP 3112)
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">unicode_literals</code>: This
                    makes every string literal interpreted as Unicode literals (PEP 3112)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>A list of the <code class="literal">__future__</code> statement options is very short and it covers only a
            few syntax features. The other things that have changed like the metaclass syntax (which is an advanced
            feature covered in <a class="link" href="ch03.html"
                                  title="Chapter 3. Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level">Chapter 3</a>, <span
                    class="emphasis"><em>Syntax Best Practices – above the Class Level</em></span>), are a lot harder to
            maintain. Reliably handling of multiple standard library reorganizations also cannot be solved by <code
                    class="literal">future</code> statements. Happily, there are some tools that aim to provide a
            consistent layer of ready-to-use compatibility. The most commonly known is Six (<a class="ulink"
                                                                                               href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/</a>)
            that provides whole common 2/3 compatibility boilerplate as a single module. The other promising but
            slightly less popular tool is the future module (<a class="ulink" href="http://python-future.org/">http://python-future.org/</a>).
        </p>
        <p>In some situations, developers may not want to include additional dependencies in some small packages. A
            common practice is the additional module that gathers all the compatibility code, usually named <code
                    class="literal">compat.py</code>. Here is an example of such a <code class="literal">compat</code>
            module taken from the <code class="literal">python-gmaps</code> project (<a class="ulink"
                                                                                        href="https://github.com/swistakm/python-gmaps">https://github.com/swistakm/python-gmaps</a>):
        </p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import sys

if sys.version_info &lt; (3, 0, 0):
    import urlparse  # noqa

    def is_string(s):
        return isinstance(s, basestring)

else:
    from urllib import parse as urlparse  # noqa

    def is_string(s):
        return isinstance(s, str)</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Such a <code class="literal">compat.py</code> module is popular even in projects that depends on Six for 2/3
            compatibility because it is a very convenient way to store code that handles compatibility with different
            versions of packages used as dependencies.</p>
