    <p>The main Python implementation is written in the C language and is called <span
            class="strong"><strong>CPython</strong></span>. It is the one that the majority of people refer to when they
        talk about Python. When the language evolves, the C implementation is changed accordingly. Besides C, Python is
        available in a few other implementations that are trying to keep up with the mainstream. Most of them are a few
        milestones behind CPython, but provide a great opportunity to use and promote the language in a specific
        environment.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of alternative Python implementations available. The Python Wiki page on that topic (<a
                class="ulink" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations">https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations</a>)
            features more than 20 different language variants, dialects, or implementations of Python interpreter built
            with something else than C. Some of them implement only a subset of the core language syntax, features, and
            built-in extensions but there is at least a few that are almost fully compatible with CPython. The most
            important thing to know is that while some of them are just toy projects or experiments, most of them were
            created to solve some real problems – problems that were either impossible to solve with CPython or required
            too much of the developer's effort. Examples of such problems are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">

        </div>
        <p>This section provides a short description of subjectively most popular and up-to-date choices that are

    <div class="section" title="Stackless Python">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">Stackless Python</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Stackless Python advertises itself as an enhanced version of Python. Stackless is named so because it avoids
            depending on the C call stack for its own stack. It is in fact a modified CPython code that also adds some
            new features that were missing from core Python implementation at the time Stackless was created. The most
            important of them are microthreads managed by the interpreter as a cheap and lightweight alternative to
            ordinary threads that must depend on system kernel context switching and tasks scheduling.</p>
        <p>The latest available versions are 2.7.9 and 3.3.5 that implement 2.7 and 3.3 versions of Python respectively.
            All the additional features provided by Stackless are exposed as a framework within this distribution
            through the built-in <code class="literal">stackless</code> module.</p>
        <p>Stackless isn't the most popular alternative implementation of Python, but it is worth knowing because ideas
            introduced in it have had a strong impact on the language community. The core switching functionality was
            extracted from Stackless and published as an independent package named <code class="literal">greenlet</code>,
            which is now a basis for many useful libraries and frameworks. Also, most of its features were
            re-implemented in PyPy—another Python implementation that will be featured later. Refer to <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                          href="http://stackless.readthedocs.org/">http://stackless.readthedocs.org/</a>.

    <div class="section" title="Jython">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">Jython</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Jython is a Java implementation of the language. It compiles the code into Java byte code, and allows the
            developers to seamlessly use Java classes within their Python modules. Jython allows people to use Python as
            the top-level scripting language on complex application systems, for example, J2EE. It also brings Java
            applications into the Python world. Making Apache Jackrabbit (which is a document repository API based on
            JCR; see <a class="ulink" href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org">http://jackrabbit.apache.org</a>) available in
            a Python program is a good example of what Jython allows.</p>
        <p>The latest available version of Jython is Jython 2.7, and this corresponds to 2.7 version of the language. It
            is advertised as implementing nearly all of the core Python standard library and uses the same regression
            test suite. The version of Jython 3.x is under development.</p>
        <p>The main differences of Jython as compared to CPython implementation are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">True Java's garbage collection instead of reference
                    counting
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The lack of <span class="strong"><strong>GIL</strong></span>
                    (<span class="strong"><strong>global interpreter lock</strong></span>) allows a better utilization
                    of multiple cores in multi-threaded applications
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The main weakness of this implementation of the language is the lack of support for C Python Extension APIs,
            so no Python extensions written in C will work with Jython. This might change in the future because there
            are plans to support the C Python Extension API in Jython 3.x.</p>
        <p>Some Python web frameworks such as Pylons were known to be boosting Jython development to make it available
            in the Java world. Refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" title="IronPython">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">IronPython</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>IronPython brings Python into the .NET Framework. The project is supported by Microsoft, where IronPython's
            lead developers work. It is quite an important implementation for the promotion of a language. Besides Java,
            the .NET community is one of the biggest developer communities out there. It is also worth noting that
            Microsoft provides a set of free development tools that turn Visual Studio into full-fledged Python IDE.
            This is distributed as Visual Studio plugins named <span class="strong"><strong>PVTS</strong></span> (<span
                    class="strong"><strong>Python Tools for </strong></span>
            <span class="strong"><strong>Visual Studio</strong></span>) and is available as open source code on GitHub (<a
                    class="ulink" href="http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS">http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS</a>).</p>
        <p>The latest stable release is 2.7.5 and it is compatible with Python 2.7. Similar to Jython, there is some
            development around Python 3.x implementation, but there is no stable release available yet. Despite the fact
            that .NET runs primarily on Microsoft Windows, it is possible to run IronPython also on Mac OS X and Linux.
            This is thanks to Mono, a cross platform, open source .NET implementation.</p>
        <p>Main differences or advantages of IronPython as compared to CPython are as follows:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Similar to Jython, the lack of GIL (global
                    interpreter lock) allows the better utilization of multiple cores in multi-threaded applications
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Code written in C# and other .NET languages can be
                    easily integrated in IronPython and vice versa
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Can be run in all major web browsers through
                    Silverlight
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>When speaking about weaknesses, IronPython, again, seems very similar to Jython because it does not support
            the C Python Extension APIs. This is important for developers who would like to use packages such as numpy
            that are largely based on C extensions. There is a project called ironclad (refer to <a class="ulink"
                                                                                                    href="https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironclad">https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironclad</a>)
            that aims to allow using such extensions seamlessly with IronPython, albeit its last known supported release
            is 2.6 and development seems to have stopped at this point. Refer to <a class="ulink"
                                                                                    href="http://ironpython.net/">http://ironpython.net/</a>.

    <div class="section" title="PyPy">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">PyPy</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>PyPy is probably the most exciting implementation, as its goal is to rewrite Python into Python. In PyPy, the
            Python interpreter is itself written in Python. We have a C code layer carrying out the nuts-and-bolts work
            for the CPython implementation of Python. However, in the PyPy implementation, this C code layer is
            rewritten in pure Python.</p>
        <p>This means you can change the interpreter's behavior during execution time and implement code patterns that
            couldn't be easily done in CPython.</p>
        <p>PyPy currently aims to be fully compatible with Python 2.7, while PyPy3 is compatible with Python 3.2.5
            version.</p>
        <p>In the past, PyPy was interesting mostly for theoretical reasons, and it interested those who enjoyed going
            deep into the details of the language. It was not generally used in production, but this has changed through
            the years. Nowadays, many benchmarks show that surprisingly PyPy is often way faster than the CPython
            implementation. This project has its own benchmarking site that tracks the performance of each version
            measured using tens of different benchmarks (refer to <a class="ulink" href="http://speed.pypy.org/">http://speed.pypy.org/</a>).
            It clearly shows that PyPy with JIT enabled is at least a few times faster than CPython. This and other
            features of PyPy makes more and more developers decide to switch to PyPy in their production environments.
        </p>
        <p>The main differences of PyPy as compared to the CPython implementation are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Garbage collection is used instead of reference
                    counting
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Integrated tracing JIT compiler that allows
                    impressive improvements in performance
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Application-level Stackless features are borrowed
                    from Stackless Python
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Like almost every other alternative Python implementation, PyPy lacks the full official support of C Python
            Extension API. Still it, at least, provides some sort of support for C extensions through its CPyExt
            subsystem, although it is poorly documented and still not feature complete. Also, there is an ongoing effort
            within the community in porting NumPy to PyPy because it is the most requested feature. Refer to <a
                    class="ulink" href="http://pypy.org">http://pypy.org</a>.</p></div>
