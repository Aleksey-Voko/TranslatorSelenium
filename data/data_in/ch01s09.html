    <p>In most cases, software implementation can iterate fast because developers reuse a lot of existing components.
        Don't Repeat Yourselfâ€”this is a popular rule and motto of many programmers. Using other packages and modules to
        include them in the codebase is only a part of that culture. What also can be considered under "reused
        components" are binary libraries, databases, system services, third-party APIs, and so on. Even whole operating
        systems should be considered as reused.</p>
    <p>Backend services of web-based applications are a great example of how complex such applications can be. The
        simplest software stack usually consists of a few layers (starting from the lowest):</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A database or other kind of storage</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The application code implemented in Python</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An HTTP server such as Apache or NGINX</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Of course such stack can be even simpler but it is very unlikely. In fact, big applications are often so complex
        that it is hard to distinguish single layers. Big applications can use many different databases, be divided into
        multiple independent processes, and use many other system services for caching, queuing, logging, service
        discovery, and so on. Sadly, there are no limits for complexity and it seems that code simply follows the second
        law of thermodynamics.</p>
    <p>What really is important is that not all of the software stack elements can be isolated on the level of Python
        runtime environment. No matter whether it is an HTTP server such as NGINX or RDBMS such as PostgreSQL, they are
        usually available in different versions on different systems. Making sure that everyone in a development team
        uses the same versions of every component is very hard without proper tools. It is theoretically possible that
        all developers in a team working on a single project will be able to get the same versions of services on their
        development boxes. But all this effort is futile if they do not use the same operating system as in the
        production environment. And forcing a programmer to work on something else other than his beloved system of
        choice is impossible for sure.</p>
    <p>The problem lies in the fact that portability is still a big challenge. Not all services will work in exactly the
        same way in production environments as they do on the developer's machines and that is very unlikely to change.
        Even Python can behave differently on different systems despite how much work is put in to make it
        cross-platform. Usually, this is well documented and happens only in places that depend directly on system
        calls, but relying on the programmer's ability to remember a long list of compatibility quirks is quite an error
        prone strategy.</p>
    <p>A popular solution to this problem is by isolating whole systems as application environments. This is usually
        achieved by leveraging different types of system virtualization tools. Virtualization, of course, reduces
        performance, but with modern computers that have hardware support for virtualization, the performance loss is
        usually negligible. On the other hand, a list of possible gains is very long:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The development environment can exactly match the system
                version and services used in production, which helps in solving compatibility issues
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Definitions for system configuration tools such as
                Puppet, Chef, or Ansible (if used) can be reused for configuration of the development environment
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The newly hired team members can easily hop into the
                project if the creation of such environments is automated
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The developers can work directly with low system-level
                features that may not be available on operating systems they use for work, for example, <span
                        class="strong"><strong>FUSE</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>File System in User Space</strong></span>)
                that is not available in Windows
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" title="Virtual development environments using Vagrant">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">Virtual development environments using Vagrant</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Vagrant currently seems to be the most popular tool that provides a simple and convenient way to create and
            manage development environments. It is available for Windows, Mac OS, and a few popular Linux distributions
            (refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.vagrantup.com">https://www.vagrantup.com</a>). It does not have
            any additional dependencies. Vagrant creates new development environments in the form of virtual machines or
            containers. The exact implementation depends on a choice of virtualization providers. VirtualBox is the
            default provider and it is bundled with the Vagrant installer but additional providers are available as
            well. The most notable choices are VMware, Docker, LXC (Linux Containers), and Hyper-V.</p>
        <p>The most important configuration is provided to Vagrant in a single file named <code class="literal">Vagrantfile</code>.
            It should be independent for every project. The following are the most important things it provides:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choice of virtualization provider</li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Box used as a virtual machine image</li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choice of provisioning method</li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Shared storage between a VM and a VM's host</li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ports that need to be forwarded between a VM and its
                    host
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Syntax language for the <code class="literal">Vagrantfile</code> is Ruby. The example configuration file
            provides a good template to start the project and has an excellent documentation, so the knowledge of this
            language is not required. Template configuration can be created using a single command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>vagrant init</strong></span>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This will create a new file named <code class="literal">Vagrantfile</code> in the current working directory.
            The best place to store this file is usually the root of the related project sources. This file is already a
            valid configuration that will create a new VM using the default provider and base box image. No provisioning
            is enabled by default. After the addition of <code class="literal">Vagrantfile</code>, the new VM is started
            using:</p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>vagrant up</strong></span>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The initial start can take a few minutes because the actual box must be downloaded from the Web. There is
            also some initialization process that may take some time depending on the used provider, box, and system
            performance every time the already existing VM is brought up. Usually, this takes only a couple of seconds.
            Once the new Vagrant environment is up and running, developers can connect to SSH using this shorthand:</p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>vagrant ssh</strong></span>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This can be done anywhere in the project source tree below the location of <code
                class="literal">Vagrantfile</code>. For developers' convenience, we will look in the directories above
            for the configuration file and match it with the related VM instance. Then, it establishes the secure shell
            connection, so the development environment can be interacted with like any ordinary remote machine. The only
            difference is that the whole project source tree (root defined as a location of <code class="literal">Vagrantfile</code>)
            is available on the VM's filesystem under <code class="literal">/vagrant/</code>.</p></div>
    <div class="section" title="Containerization versus virtualization">
        <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
                <div><h2 class="title">Containerization versus virtualization</h2></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Containers are an alternative to full machine virtualization. It is a lightweight method of virtualization,
            where the kernel and operating system allow the running of multiple isolated user space instances. OS is
            shared between containers and host, so it theoretically requires less overhead than in full virtualization.
            Such a container contains only application code and its system-level dependencies, but from the perspective
            of processes running inside, it looks like a completely isolated system environment.</p>
        <p>Software containers got their popularity mostly thanks to Docker; that is one of the available
            implementations. Docker allows to describe its container in the form of a simple text document called <code
                    class="literal">Dockerfile</code>. Containers from such definitions can be built and stored. It also
            supports incremental changes, so if new things are added to the container then it does not need to be
            recreated from scratch.</p>
        <p>Different tools such as Docker and Vagrant seem to overlap in features but the main difference between them
            is the reason why these tools were built. Vagrant, as mentioned earlier, is built primarily as a tool for
            development. It allows to bootstrap the whole virtual machine with a single command, but does not allow to
            simply pack it and deploy or release as is. Docker, on the other hand, is built exactly for thatâ€”preparing
            complete containers that can be sent and deployed to production as a whole package. If implemented well,
            this can greatly improve the process of product deployment. Because of that, using Docker and similar
            solutions (Rocket, for example) during development makes sense only if it also has to be used in the
            deployment process on production. Using it only for isolation purposes during development may generate too
            much overhead and also has a drawback of not being consistent.</p></div>
