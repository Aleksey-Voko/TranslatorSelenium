    <p>Python is good for developers.</p>
    <p>No matter what operating system you or your customers are running, it will work. Unless you are coding
        platform-specific things, or using a platform-specific library, you can work on Linux and deploy on other
        systems, for example. However, that's not uncommon anymore (Ruby, Java, and many other languages work in the
        same way). Combined with the other qualities that we will discover throughout this book, Python becomes a smart
        choice for a company's primary development language.</p>
    <p>This book is focused on the latest version of Python, 3.5, and all code examples are written in this version of
        the language unless another version is explicitly mentioned. Because this release is not yet widely used, this
        chapter contains some description of the current <span class="emphasis"><em>status quo</em></span> of Python 3
        to introduce readers to it, as well as some introductory information on modern approaches to development in
        Python. This chapter covers the following topics:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to maintain compatibility between Python 2 and Python
                3
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to approach the problem of environment isolation both
                on application and operating system level for the purpose of development
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to enhance the Python prompt</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to install packages using pip</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>A book always starts with some appetizers. So, if you are already familiar with Python (especially with the
        latest 3.x branch) and know how to properly isolate environments for development purposes, you can skip the
        first two sections of this chapter and just read the other sections quickly. They describe some tools and
        resources that are not essential but can highly improve productivity in Python. Be sure to read the section on
        application-level environment isolation and pip, though, as their installation is mandatory for the rest of the
        book.</p>

        <p>Python history starts somewhere in the late 1980s, but its 1.0 release date was in the year 1994, so it is
            not a very young language. There could be a whole timeline of major Python releases mentioned here, but what
            really matters is a single date: December 3, 2008 – the release date of Python 3.0.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, seven years have passed since the first Python 3 release. It is also four years since
            the creation of PEP 404—the official document that "un-released" Python 2.8 and officially closed the 2.x
            branch. Although a lot of time has passed, there is a specific dichotomy in the Python community—while the
            language develops very fast, there is a large group of its users that do not want to move forward with
            it.</p></div>
