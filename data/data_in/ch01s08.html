    <p>Nowadays, a lot of operating systems come with Python as a standard component. Most Linux distributions and
        Unix-based systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, or OS X come with Python are either installed by default or
        available through system package repositories. Many of them even use it as part of some core components—Python
        powers the installers of Ubuntu (Ubiquity), Red Hat Linux (Anaconda), and Fedora (Anaconda again).</p>
    <p>Due to this fact, a lot of packages from PyPI are also available as native packages managed by the system's
        package management tools such as <code class="literal">apt-get</code> (Debian, Ubuntu), <code class="literal">rpm</code>
        (Red Hat Linux), or <code class="literal">emerge</code> (Gentoo). Although it should be remembered that the list
        of available libraries is very limited and they are mostly outdated when compared to PyPI. This is the reason
        why <code class="literal">pip</code> should always be used to obtain new packages in the latest version as a
        recommendation of <span class="strong"><strong>PyPA</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>Python Packaging Authority</strong></span>).
        Although it is an independent package starting from version 2.7.9 and 3.4 of CPython, it is bundled with every
        new release by default. Installing the new package is as simple as this:</p>
    <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>pip install &lt;package-name&gt;</strong></span>
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Among other features, <code class="literal">pip</code> allows forcing specific versions of packages (using the
        <code class="literal">pip install package-name==version </code>syntax) and upgrading to the latest version
        available (using the <code class="literal">––upgrade</code> switch). The full usage description for most of the
        command-line tools presented in the book can be easily obtained simply by running the command with the <code
                class="literal">-h</code> or <code class="literal">--help</code> switch, but here is an example session
        that demonstrates the most commonly used options:</p>

        <p><code class="literal">pip</code> may be used to install system-wide packages. On Unix-based and Linux
            systems, this will require super user privileges, so the actual invocation will be:</p>
        <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sudo pip install &lt;package-name&gt;</strong></span>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Note that this is not required on Windows since it does not provide the Python interpreter by default, and
            Python on Windows is usually installed manually by the user without super user privileges.</p>
        <p>Anyway, installing system-wide packages directly from PyPI is not recommended and should be avoided. This may
            seem like a contradiction with the previous statement that using <code class="literal">pip</code> is a PyPA
            recommendation, but there are some serious reasons for that. As explained earlier, Python is very often an
            important part of many packages available through operating system package repositories and may power a lot
            of important services. System distribution maintainers put a lot of effort in selecting the correct versions
            of packages to match various package dependencies. Very often, Python packages that are available from
            system's package repositories contain custom patches or are kept outdated only to ensure compatibility with
            some other system components. Forcing an update of such a package using <code class="literal">pip</code> to
            a version that breaks some backwards compatibility might break some crucial system services.</p>
        <p>Doing such things only on the local computer for development purposes is also not a good excuse. Recklessly
            using <code class="literal">pip</code> that way is almost always asking for trouble and will eventually lead
            to issues that are very hard to debug. This does not mean that installing packages from PyPI globally is a
            strictly forbidden thing, but it should always be done consciously and while knowing the related risks.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is an easy solution to this problem—environment isolation. There are various tools that
            allow the isolation of the Python runtime environment at different levels of system abstraction. The main
            idea is to isolate project dependencies from packages required by different projects and/or system services.
            The benefits of this approach are:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It solves the "Project X depends on version 1.x but
                    Project Y needs 4.x" dilemma. The developer can work on multiple projects with different
                    dependencies that may even collide without the risk of affecting each other.
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The project is no longer constrained by versions of
                    packages that are provided in his system distribution repositories.
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is no risk of breaking other system services
                    that depend on certain package versions because new package versions are only available inside such
                    an environment.
                </li>
                <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of packages that are project dependencies can
                    be easily "frozen", so it is very easy to reproduce them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The easiest and most lightweight approach to isolation is to use application-level virtual environments. They
            focus only on isolating the Python interpreter and packages available in it. They are very easy to set up
            and are very often just enough to ensure proper isolation during the development of small projects and
            packages.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in some cases, this may not be enough to ensure enough consistency and reproducibility. For
            such cases, system-level isolation is a good addition to the workflow and some available solutions to that
            are explained later in this chapter.</p></div>

        </div>
        <p>There are several ways to isolate Python at runtime. The simplest and most obvious, although hardest to
            maintain, is to manually change <code class="literal">PATH</code> and <code
                    class="literal">PYTHONPATH</code> environment variables and/or move Python binary to a different
            place to affect the way it discovers available packages and change it to a custom place where we want to
            store our project's dependencies. Fortunately, there are several tools available that help in maintaining
            virtual environments and how installed packages are stored in the system. These are mainly: <code
                    class="literal">virtualenv</code>, <code class="literal">venv</code>, and <code class="literal">buildout</code>.
            What they do under the hood is in fact the same as what we would do manually. The actual strategy depends on
            the specific tool implementation, but generally, they are more convenient to use and can provide additional
            benefits.</p>
        <div class="section" title="virtualenv">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h3 class="title">virtualenv</h3></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Virtualenv is by far the most popular tool in this list. Its name simply stands for Virtual Environment.
                It's not a part of the standard Python distribution, so it needs to be obtained using <code
                        class="literal">pip</code>. It is one of the packages that is worth installing system-wide
                (using <code class="literal">sudo</code> on Linux and Unix-based systems).</p>
            <p>Once it is installed, a new virtual environment is created using the following command:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>virtualenv ENV</strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Here, <code class="literal">ENV</code> should be replaced by the desired name for the new environment.
                This will create a new <code class="literal">ENV</code> directory in the current working directory path.
                It will contain a few new directories inside:</p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
                <ul class="itemizedlist">
                    <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">bin/</code>: This is where
                        the new Python executable and scripts/executables provided by other packages are stored.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">lib/</code> and <code
                            class="literal">include/</code>: These directories contain the supporting library files for
                        the new Python inside the virtual environment. The new packages will be installed in <code
                                class="literal">ENV/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Once the new environment is created, it needs to be activated in the current shell session using Unix's
                source command:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>source ENV/bin/activate</strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>This changes the state of the current shell sessions by affecting its environment variables. In order to
                make the user aware that he has activated the virtual environment, it will change the shell prompt by
                appending the <code class="literal">(ENV)</code> string at its beginning. Here is an example session
                that creates a new environment and activates it to illustrate this:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>$ virtualenv example</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>New python executable in example/bin/python</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>$ source example/bin/activate</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>(example)$ deactivate</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>$ </strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The important thing to note about <code class="literal">virtualenv</code> is that it depends completely
                on its state stored on a filesystem. It does not provide any additional abilities to track what packages
                should be installed in it. These virtual environments are not portable and should not be moved to
                another system/machine. This means that the new virtual environment needs to be created from scratch for
                each new application deployment. Because of that, there is a good practice used by <code
                        class="literal">virtualenv</code> users to store all project dependencies in the <code
                        class="literal">requirements.txt</code> file (this is the naming convention), as shown in the
                following code:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"># lines followed by hash (#) are treated as a comments

# strict version names are best for reproducibility
eventlet==0.17.4
graceful==0.1.1

# for projects that are well tested with different
# dependency versions the relative version specifiers
# are acceptable too
falcon&gt;=0.3.0,&lt;0.5.0

# packages without versions should be avoided unless
# latest release is always required/desired
pytz</pre>
            </div>
            <p>With such files, all dependencies can be easily installed using <code class="literal">pip</code> because
                it accepts the requirements file as its output:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>pip install -r requirements.txt</strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>What needs to be remembered is that the requirements file is not always the ideal solution because it
                does not define the exact list of dependencies, only those that are to be installed. So, the whole
                project can work without problems in a development environment but will fail to start in others if the
                requirements file is outdated and does not reflect actual state of environment. There is, of course, the
                <code class="literal">pip freeze</code> command that prints all packages in the current environment but
                it should not be used blindly—it will output everything, even packages that are not used in the project
                but installed only for testing. The other tool mentioned in the book, <code
                        class="literal">buildout</code>, addresses this issue, so it may be a better choice for some
                development teams.</p>
            <div class="note" style="" title="Note">
                <div class="inner"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
                    <p>For Windows users, <code class="literal">virtualenv</code> under Windows uses a different naming
                        for its internal structure of directories. You need to use <code class="literal">Scripts/</code>,
                        <code class="literal">Libs/</code>, and <code class="literal">Include/</code> instead of <code
                                class="literal">bin/</code>, <code class="literal">lib/</code>, <code class="literal">include/</code>,
                        to better match development conventions on that operating system. The commands used for
                        activating/deactivating the environment are also different; you need to use <code
                                class="literal">ENV/Scripts/activate.bat</code> and <code class="literal">ENV/Scripts/deactivate.bat</code>
                        instead of using <code class="literal">source</code> on <code class="literal">activate</code>
                        and <code class="literal">deactivate</code> scripts.</p></div>

            <p>Virtual environments shortly became well established and a popular tool within the community. Starting
                from Python 3.3, creating virtual environments is supported by standard library. The usage is almost the
                same as with Virtualenv, although command-line options have quite a different naming convention. The new
                <code class="literal">venv</code> module provides a <code class="literal">pyvenv</code> script for
                creating a new virtual environment:</p>
            <div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>pyvenv ENV</strong></span>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Here, <code class="literal">ENV</code> should be replaced by the desired name for the new environment.
                Also, new environments can now be created directly from Python code because all functionality is exposed
                from the built-in <code class="literal">venv</code> module. The other usage and implementation details,
                like the structure of the environment directory and activate/deactivate scripts are mostly the same as
                in Virtualenv, so migration to this solution should be easy and painless.</p>
            <p>For developers using newer versions of Python, it is recommended to use <code class="literal">venv</code>
                instead of Virtualenv. For Python 3.3, switching to <code class="literal">venv</code> may require more
                effort because in this version, it does not install <code class="literal">setuptools</code> and <code
                        class="literal">pip</code> by default in the new environment, so the users need to install them
                manually. Fortunately, it has changed in Python 3.4, and also due to the customizability of <code
                        class="literal">venv</code>, it is possible to override its behavior. The details are explained
                in the Python documentation (refer to <a class="ulink"
                                                         href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/venv.html">https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/venv.html</a>),
                but some users might find it too tricky and will stay with Virtualenv for that specific version of
                Python.</p></div>
        <div class="section" title="buildout">
            <div class="titlepage">
                <div>
                    <div><h3 class="title">buildout</h3></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Buildout is a powerful tool for bootstrapping and the deployment of applications written in Python. Some
                of its advanced features will also be explained later in the book. For a long time, it was also used as
                a tool to create isolated Python environments. Because Buildout requires a declarative configuration
                that must be changed every time there is a change in dependencies, instead of relying on the environment
                state, these environments were easier to reproduce and manage.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this has changed. The <code class="literal">buildout</code> package since version 2.0.0 no
                longer tries to provide any level of isolation from system Python installation. Isolation handling is
                left to other tools such as Virtualenv, so it is still possible to have isolated Buildouts, but things
                become a bit more complicated. A Buildout must be initialized inside an isolated environment in order to
                be really isolated.</p>
            <p>This has a major drawback as compared to the previous versions of Buildout, since it depends on other
                solutions for isolation. The developer working on this code can no longer be sure whether the
                dependencies description is complete because some packages can be installed by bypassing the declarative
                configuration. This issue can of course be solved using proper testing and release procedures, but it
                adds some more complexity to the whole workflow.</p>
            <p>To summarize, Buildout is no longer a solution that provides environment isolation but its declarative
                configuration can improve maintainability and the reproducibility of virtual environments.</p></div>

        <p>There is no best solution that will fit every use case. What is good in one organization may not fit the
            workflow of other teams. Also, every application has different needs. Small projects can easily depend on
            sole <code class="literal">virtualenv</code> or <code class="literal">venv</code> but bigger ones may
            require additional help of <code class="literal">buildout</code> to perform more complex assembly.</p>
        <p>What was not described in detail earlier is that previous versions of Buildout (buildout&lt;2.0.0) allowed
            the assembly of projects in an isolated environment with similar results as provided by Virtualenv.
            Unfortunately, 1.x branch of this project is no longer maintained, so using it for that purpose is
            discouraged.</p>
        <p>I would recommend to use <code class="literal">venv</code> module instead of Virtualenv whenever it is
            possible. So, this should be the default choice for projects targeting Python versions 3.4 and higher. Using
            <code class="literal">venv</code> in Python 3.3 may be a little inconvenient due to a lack of built-in
            support for <code class="literal">setuptools</code> and <code class="literal">pip</code>. For projects
            targeting a wider spectrum of Python run times (including alternative interpreters and 2.x branch), it seems
            that Virtualenv is the best choice.</p></div>
