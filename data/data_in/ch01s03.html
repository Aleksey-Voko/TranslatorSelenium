    <p>The Python community has a well-established way of dealing with changes. While speculative Python language ideas
        are mostly discussed on specific mailing lists (<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email"
                                                                                   href="mailto:python-ideas@python.org">python-ideas@python.org</a>&gt;</code>),
        nothing major ever gets changed without the existence of a new document called a PEP. A <span
                class="strong"><strong>PEP</strong></span> is a <span
                class="strong"><strong>Python Enhancement Proposal</strong></span>. It is a paper written that proposes
        a change on Python, and is a starting point for the community to discuss it. The whole purpose, format, and
        workflow around these documents is also standardized in the form of a Python Enhancement Proposal—precisely, PEP
        1 document (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001</a>).
    </p>
    <p>PEP documents are very important for Python and depending on the topic, they serve different purposes:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Informing</strong></span>:
                They summarize the information needed by core Python developers and notify about Python release
                schedules
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span
                    class="strong"><strong>Standardizing</strong></span>: They provide code style, documentation, or
                other guidelines
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Designing</strong></span>:
                They describe the proposed features
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>A list of all the proposed PEPs is available as in a document—PEP 0 (<a class="ulink"
                                                                               href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/</a>).
        Since they are easily accessible in one place and the actual URL is also very easy to guess, they are usually
        referred to by the number in the book.</p>
    <p>Those who are wondering what the direction is in which the Python language is heading but do not have time to
        track a discussion on Python mailing lists, the PEP 0 document can be a great source of information. It shows
        which documents have already been accepted but are not yet implemented and also which are still under
        consideration.</p>
    <p>PEPs also serve additional purposes. Very often, people ask questions like:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why does feature A work that way?</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why does Python not have feature B?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>In most such cases, the extensive answer is available in specific PEP documents where such a feature has already
        been mentioned. There are a lot of PEP documents describing Python language features that were proposed but not
        accepted. These documents are left as a historical reference.</p></div>
