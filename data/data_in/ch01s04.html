    <p>So, is Python 3, thanks to new exciting features, well adopted among its community? Sadly, not yet. The popular
        page Python 3 Wall of Superpowers (<a class="ulink" href="https://python3wos.appspot.com">https://python3wos.appspot.com</a>)
        that tracks the compatibility of most popular packages with the Python 3 branch was, until not so long ago,
        named Python 3 Wall of Shame. This situation is changing and the table of listed packages on the mentioned page
        is slowly turning "more green" with every month. Still, this does not mean that all teams building their
        applications will shortly use only Python 3. When all popular packages are available on Python 3, the popular
        excuse—the packages that we use are not ported yet—will no longer be valid.</p>
    <p>The main reason for such a situation is that porting the existing application from Python 2 to Python 3 is always
        a challenge. There are tools like 2to3 that can perform automated code translation but they do not ensure that
        the result will be 100% correct. Also, such translated code may not perform as well as in its original form
        without manual adjustments. The moving of existing complex code bases to Python 3 might involve tremendous
        effort and cost that some organizations may not be able to afford. Still such costs can be split in time. Some
        good software architecture design methodologies, such as service-oriented architecture or microservices, can
        help to achieve this goal gradually. New project components (services or microservices) can be written using the
        new technology and existing ones can be ported one at a time.</p>
    <p>In the long run, moving to Python 3 can only have beneficial effects on a project. According to PEP-404, there
        won't be a 2.8 release in the 2.x branch of Python anymore. Also, there may be a time in the future when all
        major projects such as Django, Flask, and numpy will drop any 2.x compatibility and will only be available on
        Python 3.</p>
    <p>My personal opinion on this topic can be considered controversial. I think that the best incentive for the
        community would be to completely drop Python 2 support when creating new packages. This, of course, greatly
        limits the reach of such software but it may be the only way to change the way of thinking of those who insist
        on sticking to Python 2.x.</p></div>
