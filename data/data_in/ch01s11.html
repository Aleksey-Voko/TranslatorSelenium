    <p>The Web is full of useful resources for Python developers. The most important and obvious ones were already
        mentioned earlier but here they are repeated to keep this list consistent:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python documentation</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">PyPI—Python Package Index</li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">PEP 0—Index of Python Enhancement Proposals</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>The other resources such as books and tutorials are useful but often get outdated very fast. What does not get
        outdated are the resources that are actively curated by the community or released periodically. The two that are
        mostly worth recommending are:</p>
    <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Awesome-python (<a class="ulink"
                                                                                  href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python">https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python</a>),
                which includes a curated list of popular packages and frameworks
            </li>
            <li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python Weekly (<a class="ulink"
                                                                                 href="http://www.pythonweekly.com/">http://www.pythonweekly.com/</a>)
                is a popular newsletter that delivers to its subscribers dozens of new and interesting Python packages
                and resources every week
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>These two resources will provide the reader with tons of additional reading for several months.</p></div>
