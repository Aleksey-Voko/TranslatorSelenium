    <p>A deep understanding of the programming language of choice is the most important thing to harness as an expert.
        This will always be true for any technology. Still, it is really hard to develop a good software without knowing
        the common tools and practices within the given language community. Python has no single feature that could not
        be found in some other language. So, in direct comparison of syntax, expressiveness, or performance, there will
        always be a solution that is better in one or more fields. But the area in which Python really stands out from
        the crowd is in the whole ecosystem built around the language. Its community has, for years, polished the
        standard practices and libraries that help to create more reliable software in a shorter time.</p>
    <p>The most obvious and important part of the mentioned ecosystem is a huge collection of free and open source
        packages that solve a multitude of problems. Writing new software is always an expensive and time-consuming
        process. Being able to reuse the existing code instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>reinventing the wheel</em></span>
        greatly reduces the time and costs of development. For some companies, it is the only reason their projects are
        economically feasible.</p>
    <p>Due to this reason, Python developers put a lot of effort on creating tools and standards to work with open
        source packages created by others. Starting from virtual isolated environments, improved interactive shells and
        debuggers, to programs that help to discover, search, and analyze the huge collection of packages available on
